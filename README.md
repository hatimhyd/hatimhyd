Hi, my name is Hatim Nasri, I'm currently a student in Mohammadia School of engineering in Rabat, Morocco.
My major is Networking/Telecom, though i'm more interested in networking and security, so i decided to create this github space to share with you all my projects.
hope you enjoy it, and thank you!
